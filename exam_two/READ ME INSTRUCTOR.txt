
1. Validator isn't working properly
2. Cannot get the joins to work for displaying the shows associated with the user
example: "one_show.creator_title" does not display the title. I could get this in a pseudo working condition by creating a get all method. This is not the way it should be done per exam, but it's the closest I could get as of right now. I even wrote the code out for joining the two tables together, but for some reason, it still doesn't want to display the information.

THIS IS SLOWLY TURNING INTO SPAGHETTI AND IM STARTING HATE MYSELF. HELP ME.
